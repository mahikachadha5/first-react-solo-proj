# My First Project Using React

This is my first project using React, and it serves as a record of all the trips I took during my time studying abroad in Madrid. The focus of this project was to build and enhance my skills in creating custom components, using props, and managing data within a React application. The application displays a collection of trips, where each trip is described by an image, a location, a description, dates of the trip, and a clickable link to the location.

## Technologies Used
- React: For building user interfaces and managing component states.
- HTML/CSS: For structuring and styling the application. I used CSS Flexbox for formatting the reused "cards"
- JavaScript: For adding interactivity and managing the data within the application.
